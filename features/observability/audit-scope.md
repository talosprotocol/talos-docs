# Audit Scope

> **Problem**: People assume wrong things about what's audited.  
> **Guarantee**: Explicit definition of what is and isn't recorded.  
> **Non-goal**: Covering every possible event.

## What Is Audited

### ✅ Message Events

| Field | Stored | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Content hash | ✅ Yes | SHA-256 of plaintext |
| Sender ID | ✅ Yes | DID or peer ID |
| Recipient ID | ✅ Yes | DID or peer ID |
| Timestamp | ✅ Yes | ISO 8601 |
| Sender signature | ✅ Yes | Ed25519 |
| Message type | ✅ Yes | TEXT, FILE, MCP, etc. |
| **Plaintext content** | ❌ No | Only hash stored |
| **Encrypted content** | ❌ No | Not persisted |

**Implication**: You can prove a message was sent, but you cannot recover its contents from the audit log alone.

---

### ✅ Session Events

| Event | Audited |
|-------|---------|
| Session established | ✅ Yes |
| Session terminated | ✅ Yes |
| Peer identities | ✅ Yes |
| Session ID | ✅ Yes |
| Prekey bundle exchange | ✅ Yes |
| Ratchet state | ❌ No (security) |

---

### ✅ Capability Events

| Event | Audited |
|-------|---------|
| Capability granted | ✅ Yes |
| Capability scope | ✅ Yes |
| Capability constraints | ✅ Yes |
| Capability expiry | ✅ Yes |
| Capability revoked | ✅ Yes |
| Revocation reason | ✅ Yes |
| Delegation chain | ✅ Yes |
| **Capability token value** | ❌ No (security) |

**Implication**: You can prove a capability was granted, but cannot reconstruct the token.

---

### ✅ Identity Events

| Event | Audited |
|-------|---------|
| Identity created | ✅ Yes |
| Public key | ✅ Yes |
| DID document | ✅ Yes (if anchored) |
| Key rotation | ✅ Yes |
| Identity revocation | ✅ Yes |
| **Private key** | ❌ No (never) |

---

### ✅ MCP Tool Events

| Event | Audited |
|-------|---------|
| Tool invocation request | ✅ Yes |
| Tool ID | ✅ Yes |
| Invoking agent | ✅ Yes |
| Capability reference | ✅ Yes |
| Invocation hash | ✅ Yes |
| Tool response hash | ✅ Yes (if signed) |
| **Tool parameters** | ⚠️ Hash only |
| **Tool response content** | ⚠️ Hash only |

**Implication**: You can prove which tool was called by whom, but not the exact input/output.

---

## What Is NOT Audited

### ❌ Message Contents

Plaintext message contents are **never** stored in the audit log.

**Why**: Privacy. The audit log may be shared or anchored publicly.

**What's stored instead**: SHA-256 hash of the plaintext.

**Verification**: If you have the plaintext, you can prove it matches the hash.

---

### ❌ Encryption Keys

Session keys, ratchet state, and ephemeral keys are **never** audited.

**Why**: Security. Auditing keys would undermine forward secrecy.

---

### ❌ Network Metadata

| Metadata | Audited |
|----------|---------|
| IP addresses | ❌ No |
| Transport details | ❌ No |
| Routing paths | ❌ No |
| Connection times | ❌ No |

**Why**: Privacy. Talos minimizes metadata in the persistent layer.

---

### ❌ Local Agent State

| State | Audited |
|-------|---------|
| Agent configuration | ❌ No |
| Local storage | ❌ No |
| Memory state | ❌ No |
| Pending messages | ❌ No |

**Why**: Out of scope. Local state is agent's responsibility.

---

## Audit Levels

Talos supports configurable audit verbosity:

| Level | What's Logged |
|-------|---------------|
| `minimal` | Message hashes, session starts/ends |
| `standard` | + Capabilities, identity events |
| `verbose` | + All MCP invocations, detailed metadata |
| `debug` | + Internal protocol events (dev only) |

```python
client = TalosClient.create("agent", audit_level="standard")
```

---

## Privacy Considerations

### What Can Be Proven

With audit log access, you can prove:

- ✅ A message was sent from A to B at time T
- ✅ A capability was granted with scope S
- ✅ A tool was invoked by agent A
- ✅ An identity existed with public key K

### What Cannot Be Proven (Without Original Data)

- ❌ What the message said
- ❌ What the tool parameters were
- ❌ What the tool returned
- ❌ Why a capability was granted

### Selective Disclosure

If you have the original data, you can:

1. Compute its hash
2. Show it matches the audit entry
3. Prove the entry exists via Merkle proof

This enables **privacy-preserving accountability**: reveal only what you choose.

---

## Blockchain Anchoring

The following is anchored on-chain:

| Data | On-Chain |
|------|----------|
| Merkle root | ✅ Yes (periodic) |
| Identity anchors | ✅ Yes (optional) |
| Capability hashes | ✅ Yes (optional) |
| Revocation events | ✅ Yes |
| **Full audit log** | ❌ No |
| **Any content** | ❌ No |

**Frequency**: Audit roots anchored every N minutes or M entries (configurable).

---

## Summary Table

| Category | Logged | Hash Only | Not Logged |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Message existence | ✅ | | |
| Message content | | ✅ | |
| Participant IDs | ✅ | | |
| Session events | ✅ | | |
| Session keys | | | ✅ |
| Capabilities granted | ✅ | | |
| Capability tokens | | | ✅ |
| Tool invocations | ✅ | | |
| Tool parameters | | ✅ | |
| Identity events | ✅ | | |
| Private keys | | | ✅ |
| Network metadata | | | ✅ |
